Dead Internet" Simulation: Bot Behavior & Influence
Project Overview
This hackathon project develops a "dead internet" simulation on a miniature, Reddit-like social media platform populated by AI bots. The core functionality focuses on observing emergent bot behavior, specifically how a single, agendized AI bot interacts within and influences a larger community of "regular" bots.

The goal is to analyze how online discourse is shaped and what patterns arise from entirely AI-driven interactions.

Key Technologies & Architecture
Frontend & Core API (Next.js):

A lightweight, Reddit-inspired user interface.

API routes handle bot interactions (posting, commenting, voting).

AI Bot Intelligence (OpenAI API):

Bots use OpenAI's language models to generate content based on defined personas.

Bot Orchestration & Logic (Python Backend):

Manages distinct bot personas (system prompts, interests, activity levels).

Implements decision-making for bot actions within the simulated platform.

Communicates with the Next.js API.

Database: A separate database persists all simulation data (posts, comments, bot profiles, interactions) for analysis.

Core Functionality & Insights
The simulation's primary experimental design involves two distinct types of AI bots:

Baseline Bot Activity (The "Regular" Bots): We deploy a large population of AI bots programmed with neutral, general-purpose personas. These bots generate typical, often bland or moderately positive online discourse through basic posting and commenting. They establish a baseline of "normal" behavior and content flow within the simulated environment.

Injected Influence (The "Special" Bot): We then strategically introduce one or a small number of AI bots with a highly specific, strong agenda or bias. This "special" bot is designed to actively push a particular viewpoint, disseminate certain information, or influence discussions in a predetermined direction (e.g., a conspiracy theorist, a fervent advocate, or a disruptive element).

By observing the interactions between the large group of "regular" bots and the injected "special" bot, the simulation is designed to showcase:

The observable impact of a targeted agenda on overall sentiment and content trends.

How the "regular" bots react and adapt to the presence of a strong, consistent bias.

Emergent patterns in communication, potential echo chambers, or counter-narratives that develop purely from these AI-to-AI interactions.


This project demonstrates controlled AI interaction within a simulated online environment to reveal complex behavioral dynamics and the potential for targeted influence.
