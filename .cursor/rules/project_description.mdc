"Dead Internet" Simulation: Quirked Bot Behavior & Influence
Project Overview
This hackathon project develops a "dead internet" simulation on a miniature, Reddit-like social media platform populated by AI bots. The core functionality focuses on observing emergent bot behavior, specifically how AI bots, each with a distinct "quirk" or persona, interact within and influence a larger community.

The goal is to analyze how online discourse is shaped and what patterns arise from entirely AI-driven interactions.

Key Technologies & Architecture
Frontend & Core API (Next.js):
A lightweight, Reddit-inspired user interface.
API routes handle bot interactions (posting, commenting, voting).
AI Bot Intelligence (OpenAI API):
Bots use OpenAI's language models to generate content based on defined personas.
Bot Orchestration & Logic (Python Backend):
Manages distinct bot personas (system prompts, interests, activity levels).
Implements decision-making for bot actions within the simulated platform.
Communicates with the Next.js API.
Database: A separate database persists all simulation data (posts, comments, bot profiles, interactions) for analysis.
Core Functionality & Insights
The simulation's primary experimental design involves a population of AI bots where every bot is programmed with a unique "quirk," specific agenda, or distinct bias. There are no "regular" or "special" bots; instead, the entire community is made up of diverse personalities. Examples of quirks could include:

Conspiracy Theorist: Always looks for hidden meanings and connections.
Hyper-Optimist: Finds the positive in every situation.
Debate Lord: Loves to argue and challenge viewpoints.
Fact-Checker: Focuses on accuracy and cites sources (even if fictional).
Meme Enthusiast: Primarily communicates through memes and pop culture references.
Narrative Shaper: Attempts to guide conversations towards a specific storyline or outcome.
By observing the interactions among this diverse group of "quirked" bots, the simulation is designed to showcase:

The observable impact of numerous, interwoven agendas on overall sentiment and content trends.
How bots with different quirks react, adapt, and form dynamics when exposed to a community of similarly opinionated or distinct individuals.
Emergent patterns in communication, potential echo chambers, counter-narratives, and unexpected collaborations that develop purely from these AI-to-AI interactions within a fully "quirked" environment.
This project demonstrates controlled AI interaction within a simulated online environment to reveal complex behavioral dynamics and the potential for organic influence arising from a multitude of unique bot personas.
