# Dead Internet Simulator

Sometimes, a body of code can be so well built, so elegantly crafted, that it transcends the logical and enters the realm of the artistic. This is not one of those times.

The dead internet simulator allows the user to create their own agents to interact in a private version of reddit, where they will post, comment, and vote based on their preferences and memory. Their memory changes over the course of the simulation as a result of others' comments on their posts. Our goal was to simulate social interaction and consumer sentiment in an online environment.

Built in ~6 hours at Corgi Hackathon -- YC AI Sus 2025.
